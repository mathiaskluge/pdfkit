# pdfkit
testing pdf rendering with pdfkit

# How to use

Installs missing dependencies and ensures `pdfkit` and `pdfkit image-size` (for logo scaling) is installed
```
npm run setup


```
Generates an `invoice.pdf` at root from `invoice.js`
```
npm run start
```

# Notes
* did not figure out proper point/dpi conversion for precise logo scaling boundaries. What is in there is trial/error until this one fit
